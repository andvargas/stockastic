# ✅ Swing Entry Checklist (Bounce at Support)

## 1. Identify Strong Support

- Look for a **level that held multiple times** (horizontal support, trendline, or major MA like 50/200).
- Bonus: Higher timeframe support (weekly/monthly) is stronger.

## 2. Wait for Reversal Signal

At the support, look for **price action confirmation**:

- Bullish engulfing candle  
- Hammer / pin bar  
- Morning star  
- Or simply a daily close **back above the level**

📌 *Don’t buy just because price touched support — wait for proof sellers are done.*

## 3. Check Volume / Momentum

- Reversal candle has **higher volume than previous candles**.  
- RSI: ideally above 30 (not oversold panic mode).  
- MACD cross or bullish divergence = extra confirmation.

---

## 4. Entry Trigger

- Enter on the **next day’s break above the reversal candle’s high**.  
  - Example: Support = 50, reversal candle high = 51 → Buy stop at 51.10.  
- This way, you only enter if buyers follow through.

---

## 5. Risk Management

- **Stop-loss**: Place just under support / reversal candle low.  
  - Example: Support at 50, candle low = 49 → Stop at 48.80.  
- **Target**: Nearest resistance / recent swing high.  
- Risk-to-Reward must be **≥ 2:1**.  
  - Example: If stop is $2, aim for $4 profit.

## 🔎 Example in Action

- Stock drops to support at $100.  
- Prints a hammer with low at $98, closes at $101.  
- Next day, place buy stop at $102.  
- Stop at $97 (under hammer low).  
- Target $110 (previous resistance).  
- Risk = $5, Reward = $8 → ✅ 1.6:1 (acceptable if strong setup, ideally >2:1).

⚡ **Pro Tip:** Don’t take every “touch”. Take the **cleanest setups** where all 5 boxes tick ✅
